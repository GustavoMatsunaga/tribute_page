# ABOUT :speech_balloon:
This is a website created to fulfill a user stories, and tell about the japanese immigration, in order to complete the FreeCodeCamp challenge. It also had some challenges besides creating the website.
The project was deployed here : <a href="https://gustavomatsunaga.github.io/tribute_page/" target="_blank">Tribute Page</a>

## Challenges :bulb:
<ul>
<li>My tribute page should have an element with a corresponding id="main", which contains all other elements.</li></br>
<li>I should see an element with a corresponding id="title", which contains a string that describes the subject of the tribute page.</li></br>
<li>I should see a div element with a corresponding id="img-div".</li></br>
<li> Within the img-div element, I should see an img element with a corresponding id="image".</li></br>
<li>Within the img-div element, I should see an element with a corresponding id="img-caption" that contains textual content describing the image shown in img-div.</li></br>
<li>I should see an element with a corresponding id="tribute-info", which contains textual content describing the subject of the tribute page.</li></br>
<li>I should see an a element with a corresponding id="tribute-link", which links to an outside site that contains additional information about the subject of the tribute page. HINT: You must give your element an attribute of target and set it to _blank in order for your link to open in a new tab (i.e. target="_blank").</li></br>
